Angular Dart SID at V7
develop branch - Day 1 

   - The Tour of Heroes app uses the double curly braces of interpolation (a type of one-way data binding) to display the app title and properties of a Hero object.
   - You wrote a multi-line template using Dart’s template strings to make the template readable.
   - You added a two-way data binding to the <input> element using the built-in ngModel directive. This binding both displays the hero’s name and allows users to change it.
   - You added formDirectives to the directives argument of the app’s @Component annotation so that Angular knows where ngModel is defined.
